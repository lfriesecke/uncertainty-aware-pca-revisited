# Uncertainty-Aware PCA Revisited

This repository contains the official authors implementation associated with the IEEE VIS 2025 submission, "Uncertainty-Aware PCA Revisited".


## Overview

The codebase contains an interface for:
- Computing and exporting a covariance stability glyph, that encodes the stability of the major eigenvectors of an uncertain covariance matrix
- Projecting uncertain datasets to two dimensions, using a sampling-based approach


## Getting started

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This code was tested using Python 3.13.5.

2. Clone the repository, e.g. using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lfriesecke/uncertainty-aware-pca-revisited.git
```

3. Setup a virtual environment and install all required dependencies. We recommend using `virtualenv`:

   1. Install `virtualenv` using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

   2. Navigate to the project root directory and create a virtual environment named `venv_uapcar`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv_uapcar
   ```

   3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv_uapcar/bin/activate      // on Linux & MacOS
   venv_uapcar/Scripts/activate.bat     // in Windows CMD
   venv_uapcar/Scripts/Activate.ps1     // in Windows Powershell
   ```

   4. Install the required packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Execute the given code. To generate the glyph or the projection of one of the provided datasets, run one of the examples, e.g. `example_glyph_iris.py`. The resulting `.off` or `.pdf` file will be saved to the current directory:
```bash
cd src
python example_glyph_iris.py
```

5. Exit the virtual environment by running:
```bash
deactivate
```


### Covariance stability glyph:

Computing a covariance stability glyph requires only a list of multivariate normal distributions. See the `MNDistribution` class in `distribution.py` for details. It is also possible to load the distributions used for the submission:

```python
from uapcar import dataset_iris

dists = dataset_iris()
```

The glyph can be computed by creating a new `Glyph` object and specifying the number of values for `alpha` ($\alpha \in [0, \pi]$) and `beta` ($\beta \in [0, 2\pi]$) for which the glyph should be evaluated. It is recommended to set `num_alpha` to `91` and `num_beta` to `181`:

```python
from uapcar import dataset_iris, Glyph

dists = dataset_iris()
glyph = Glyph(dists_iris, 91, 181)
```

Then, the computed glyph can then be saved to an OFF file using the `save_off` function:

```python
from uapcar import dataset_iris, Glyph

dists = dataset_iris()
glyph = Glyph(dists_iris, 91, 181)
glyph.save_off("glyph")
```


### Sampling based projection:

The `plot_projection_2D` function can be used to project a list of multivariate normal distributions. The function requires a list of distributions and an axis on which to display the final result. Also a list of colors for the contour lines can be specified. See `sampling.py` for other arguments and `utils/colors.py` for a list of colors used in the submission.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.gridspec import GridSpec
from uapcar import colors_contour_iris, dataset_iris, plot_projection_2D

dists = dataset_iris()

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(1., 1.))
gs = GridSpec(1, 1, figure=fig)
ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])
plot_projection_2D(dists, ax, colors=colors_contour_iris)

plt.show()
```
